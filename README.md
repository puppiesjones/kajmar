## Welcome To KAJMAR Farms

### Owning a Weimaraner

The Weimaraner is a large dog that was originally bred for hunting in the early 19th century. Early Weimaraners were used by royalty for hunting large game such as boar, bear and deer. As the popularity of large game hunting began to decline, Weimaraners were used for hunting smaller animals like fowl, rabbits and foxes.
The Weimaraner is an all-purpose gun dog. The name comes from the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Karl August, whose court was located in the city of Weimar in Germany.

### Temperament

The Weimaraner is an energetic hunting dog, prized for its physical endurance and stamina, with a strong, instinctive hunting abilities.  A Weimaraner requires frequent exercise and will appreciate games and play. An active owner is more likely to provide the vigorous exercise and games required. A Weimaraner requires appropriate training to learn how to be calm and control its behavior.

### As a Hunting Dog

Weimaraners have an excessive amount of energy that requires a good outlet. They are well-rounded hunting dogs that excel at hunting, tracking, pointing and retrieving both on land and in the water. The Weimaraner is a very people-oriented breed. They have a very strong desire to work and live with their owners, making the breed a good choice for the novice hunter. It requires a gentle touch when training to hunt and it often learns best from a seasoned hunting dog.

### Right Dog for you?
Weimaraners are not an independent breed and love to be with their owner.Highly intelligent, often times tending to be more human in nature than canine, is an accurate description. Coupled with their intelligence is their ability to be demanding and obstinate. If you want a dog who is going to be very much part of your life, demanding attention yet repaying you with complete devotion and companionship, you will love the breed.
